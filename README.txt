The code is "Imageanalisys4.py".
Before you run the code, CHANGE THE DIRECTORIES of the photos!!!!
My code should run with any Venus photo similar to mine, to be sure, first install the entire folder with all my data

You can find here my first attempts with Kasa fit method and open-cv library.
Make sure you have installed cv2.
Otherwise type in your  shell:
>>> pip install opencv-python
